# Amazon Hackon Shopbot

## Introduction
Amazon Hackon Shopbot is an innovative project that combines the power of Python and Node.js to create a tool that gathers product reviews from Amazon and uses AI to generate marketing content based on these reviews. This tool provides users with a convenient way to leverage customer feedback for product descriptions, use cases, and positive phrases.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
Python: Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download and install it from Python's official website.

Node Package Manager (NPM): Ensure you have NPM installed. You can install it by downloading and installing Node.js.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-hackon-shopbot.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd amazon-hackon-shopbot
Install the project dependencies by running:
npm install

## Running the Application
To run the application locally, execute the following command:
node app.js
This will start the server, making the project accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Usage
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Access the "Store ASIN" page, where you can provide an Amazon ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) for a product you want to analyze.

Once you enter the ASIN and submit, the application will start gathering reviews and using AI to generate product descriptions, use cases, and positive phrases.

The generated content is displayed to you, providing valuable marketing insights based on customer reviews.
